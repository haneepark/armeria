# API Link Test

## Type

When you are using multiple decorators, you might want to pass some value to the next decorator.
You can do this by attaching attributes to a [RequestContext](type).

## Type with expressions

You can also iterate over all the attributes in a context using [RequestContext#attrs()](type):

Then, you can access them via [RequestContext#attr(AttributeKey)](type):

You can also create a [RequestOptions](type) and pass it
to [WebClient#execute(HttpRequest,RequestOptions)?full](type) with an [HttpRequest](type).

## Type on title: [WebClientRequestPreparation](type)

## Plural

- `circuitOpenWindow`:
  - The duration that a [CircuitBreaker](type) remains in `OPEN` state. All [Request](typeplural) are blocked
    off responding with [FailFastException](type) during this state. The default value is `10` seconds.
- `counterSlidingWindow`:
  - The duration of a sliding window that a [CircuitBreaker](type) counts successful and failed [Request](typeplural) in it. The default value is `20` seconds.
